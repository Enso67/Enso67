# integer division

#5//2 rounds down to 2

#can be used for change
#ceil rounds up

#using exponents 3**2 = 9

#remainder operator
##performs division and return remainder 5%2 gives you 1
## used to find even and odd numbers, odd numbers give 1 or 0 for even
# x**0.5 is the same as square root

#Pythagoreon Theorem
